import { LinkCard, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When checking the compliance of user interfaces with figma design, a lot of inconsistencies were found.
In fact, every screen does not match the design.


## IOS

The IOS version of the application is working and performs the basic functionality of the application. However, it has very significant differences from the design.


Here is a comparison of the first screen. You can see the rest of the screens by clicking on the link below the image.

## Android

I didn't do a compliance check for the Android version because it just doesn't work as it should.
There are a lot of bugs, performance issues, and other problems.

    At the moment, the Stack-Track app does not have support for the Android version. To fix this, we need to make significant changes to the code base
