This section describes all the errors found in the project that are related to checking types and general linting rules.


## Typescript check
The static TypeScript type checker found **32 errors** in the project.

This means that the code contains type mismatches, misuse of APIs, missing types, or other type safety violations that the TypeScript compiler cannot resolve.

<Code code={tsCheck} lang="sh" type='terminal' title='npm run tsc' />


Reasons why you shouldn't make such mistakes:
- **Reduced code reliability:** type errors often lead to unpredictable runtime behavior.
- **Loss of TS benefits:** the main purpose of using TypeScript is to provide type safety. Ignoring type errors negates this advantage and effectively turns TypeScript into regular JavaScript with additional syntax.
- **Loss of TS benefits:** the main purpose of using TypeScript is to provide type safety. Ignoring type errors negates this advantage and effectively turns TypeScript into regular JavaScript with additional syntax.
- **Security issues:** improper type handling can lead to security vulnerabilities, especially when dealing with user data or APIs.
- **Scalability issues:** as an application grows, unchecked type errors can accumulate, creating technical debt that becomes increasingly difficult to resolve.
- **Deterioration of the development experience:** lack of correct types deprives developers of IDE auto-completion and hints, which slows down development.
- **Decreased documentation quality:** TypeScript types serve as a form of code documentation. Incorrect types mislead developers.
- **Problems with updating dependencies:** incorrect types can hide incompatibilities with new versions of libraries.



<Aside type="danger" title=' '>
    Type errors can pose a serious danger to the production version of an application.
    For example, an attempt to call a method on `undefined` or access a property of a non-existent object will cause the application to crash.

## Linting check

Static code analysis using a linter revealed **293 errors** and **41 warnings** in the project.
This indicates significant violations of the established coding rules, style, and potential code quality issues.


<Code code={lintCheck} lang="sh" type='terminal' title='npm run lint' />

Reasons why this is problematic:
1. **Reduced code quality:** leaders identify potential bugs, suboptimal patterns, and anti-patterns that can lead to bugs, performance, and security issues.
2. **Inconsistent code base:** a high number of linter errors often indicates inconsistent adherence to coding standards, making code difficult to read and maintain.
3. **Technical debt:** ignoring linter warnings leads to the accumulation of technical debt, which becomes increasingly difficult to repay over time.
4. **Complication of code review:** inconsistent code style and rule violations complicate the code review process and increase the time it takes to understand it.
5. **Potential runtime errors:** many linter rules are aimed at preventing common errors that can occur at runtime (e.g., using variables before they are declared, improper comparison, etc.)
6. **Scaling issues:** as the project and team grow, inconsistent code becomes a bigger problem, especially for new developers.
7. **Complications of automation:** CI/CD processes often include linter checking, and a large number of errors can block automatic deployment.
